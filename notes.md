DimensionalArkBishops is a small guild in which members enjoy thinking outside the box. Doing away with standard builds, and operating as a well coordinated party, DAB can handle objectives normally meant for large groups. Using Teamspeak 3, even when not on the same game at any given time, members enjoy just hanging out. We are internally competitive and never back down from challenges. 

We are currently recruiting players of all skill levels and professions. If you are interested feel free to join us on Teamspeak (link in this website). 

Even when not in Guild Wars our members still hang out on Teamspeak.

Core Members 
-These players have been with our group a long time, a brief description of each is below


POWERHOUSE101 - Variable Support
-Powerhouse founded DAB in Spring 2008.

In most games I go by POWERHOUSE101 (Pawrhowse in GW). I enjoy the challenge of playing support roles such as Engineer, and playing them on the front line. I am always looking for the next strategic advantage. 

Other games playing: Forza Horizon 3, Fallout 4

Tymestrike/Myth - Front line tank, Damage per Hit

 My handle is tymestrike, I joined Dimensional Ark Bishops in spring of ’14. I tend to focus on Tank style characters for games where that is viable. I prefer to be in the thick of battle but not be the one doing the most damage, I operate on the concept “If I am the biggest threat on the battlefield, or appear to be, my allies can lay waste to everything around me.” I played WoW from just before Burning Crusade launch till just after Cataclysm as a Raid tank Paladin, that style of play has never left me.

Other Games: Warframe, Endless Legend, The Witcher
