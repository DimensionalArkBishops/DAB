Server: Gate of Madness  
Rep requirement: None

We are a small, casual guild. Players who have less time to play or are new to the game are given priority when we decide what we are doing each night. Currently, our only planned events are Fractals/Dungeons and (attempted) Raids on Tuesdays, and Guiild Missions on Thursdays. Sometimes we will play WvW being a small roaming party. Overall, we are very flexible in what we do and never back down from a challenge. 


We like to think outside the box. We experiment with builds and challenge the general meta. Being a small group and having played many games, we have come to rely on each other and have become self sufficient and well coordinated. We like to improve our builds by fighting in our guild hall and also looking for the best stat combo's that compliment the desired function of the build in question. Most events and champs are not a problem for us. 

Since we use Teamspeak 3, even when not on the same game at a given time, we enjoy just hanging out. 

We are currently recruiting players of all skill levels and professions. If you are interested feel free to [join us on Teamspeak](ts.html).


If you are interested, please feel free to join us in TeamSpeak, you can get to know us and see if we really are the kind of group you are looking for.

# Core Members
These players have been with our group a long time, a brief description of each is below


## POWERHOUSE101 - Variable Support (Engineer/Scrapper/Holosmith)
Powerhouse founded DAB in Spring 2008.

In most games I go by POWERHOUSE101 (Pawrhowse in GW). I enjoy the challenge of playing support roles such as Engineer, and playing them on the front line. I am always looking for the next strategic advantage.

Other games playing: Forza Horizon 3, Fallout 4

## Bishop - DPS (Warrior)
Cofounder and Teamspeak owner. Enjoys playing front line DPS roles. 

Bishop goes by Xavier Baysh in Guild Wars.

Other games: Star Trek Online, World Of Tanks


## Lafayette/Vong - Jack of all trades (All Classes)
Support leaning play style

Other games: Overwatch, Warframe, GTA V


## NapalmClaw/Abbot - Condition (Elementalist, Necromancer)
Main class: Elementalist

Abbot plays condition DPS roles. 

Other games playing: Warframe, Overwatch, GTA V


## Doom - Area DPS (Guardian)
Main class Gardian

Doom plays with the idea of "kill everything" (all at once). Using builds that take down massive numbers of enemies simultaneously, Doom usually keeps the extra agro down.

Other games playing: GTA V, Kerbal Space Program, Fallout 4


## Arithmancer - Condition Support (Thief)
Team coder, website owner

Support condition DPS.  


## Tymestrike/Myth - Front line tank, Damage per Hit (Guardian, Thief)

My handle is tymestrike, I joined Dimensional Ark Bishops in spring of ’14. I tend to focus on Tank style characters for games where that is viable. I
prefer to be in the thick of battle but not be the one doing the most damage, I operate on the concept “If I am the biggest threat on the battlefield,
or appear to be, my allies can lay waste to everything around me.” I played WoW from just before Burning Crusade launch till just after Cataclysm as a
Raid tank Paladin, that style of play has never left me.

Other Games: Warframe, Endless Legend, The Witcher
