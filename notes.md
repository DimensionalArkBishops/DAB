DimensionalArkBishops is a small guild in which members enjoy thinking outside the box. Doing away with standard builds, and operating as a well coordinated party, DAB can handle objectives normally meant for large groups. Using Teamspeak 3, even when not on the same game at any given time, members enjoy just hanging out. We are internally competitive and never back down from challenges.

Tymestrike/Myth
 My handle is tymestrike, I joined Dimensional Ark Bishops in spring of ’14. I tend to focus on Tank style characters for games where that is viable. I prefer to be in the thick of battle but not be the one doing the most damage, I operate on the concept “If I am the biggest threat on the battlefield, or appear to be, my allies can lay waste to everything around me.” I played WoW from just before Burning Crusade launch till just after Cataclysm as a Raid tank Paladin, that style of play has never left me.
